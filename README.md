Oak Standard Library
====================

This is the reference implementation standard library for the [Oak programming language](https://github.com/OutOfTheVoid/OakC).

It is written in Oak, and minimally, C, and depends on the C standard library. Currently, it is a work in progress, and mostly serves as a realistic test-case for the compiler.
